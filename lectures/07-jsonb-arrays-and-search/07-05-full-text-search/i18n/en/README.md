# 07-05 — full-text search

Brew's knowledge base has grown: brewing articles, guides, barista notes. A naive search — `body LIKE '%brew%'` — is almost useless: it won't find `brewing` for the query `brew`, can't tell a title from a body, can't sort by relevance, and on a large table always reads everything. Postgres can do real full-text search right in the database — without a separate engine like Elasticsearch, as long as the volumes are moderate.

The goal of this unit is to assemble a working FTS on built-in types: text → `tsvector` (normalized lexemes), query → `tsquery`, the `@@` operator for matching, and `ts_rank` for ranking. Plus two production techniques: a generated `tsvector` column (the database keeps it in sync itself) and `setweight` (the title matters more than the body).

## tsvector and tsquery: what the search sees

FTS doesn't search raw text — it works on a `tsvector`: text parsed into **lexemes** (normalized words) with positions. The parsing is done by a language configuration: `'english'` reduces words to a stem (stemming: `brewing` and `brew` → one lexeme `brew`, `hours` → `hour`) and drops stop words (`is`, `about`, `for` — noise you don't search by). The query is normalized too — into a `tsquery` — by the same configuration, so `brewing` in the query finds `brew` in the text. The `@@` operator checks whether a `tsvector` satisfies a query. That's the difference from `LIKE`: the search goes by the meaning of words, not by substring.

## A generated column and weights

Running `to_tsvector` on every query is expensive; better to compute it once at write time and index it. We make the `tsvector` a **generated column** (`GENERATED ALWAYS AS (...) STORED`): the database recomputes it on any `INSERT`/`UPDATE` — no triggers. We put a **GIN index** under it, and `@@` flies by index, not by scan (06-05). Then `setweight`: we tag the title's lexemes with weight `A`, the body's with `B`, and concatenate (`||`). When ranking, `ts_rank` weighs a title match more than a body match — relevance out of the box.

## ts_rank: sorting by relevance

`@@` answers "yes/no," but the user needs an order. `ts_rank(tsv, query)` gives a number that grows with how often and how "heavily" (per `setweight`) the query lexemes occur. We sort by it `DESC` — and the most relevant come up top. In the demo the query `brew` finds two articles, but "Cold brew guide" has the word both in the title (weight `A`) and the body (`B`), so its rank is noticeably higher.

## What our code shows

A lab table `kb_articles` (an English knowledge base) with a generated `tsvector` + GIN. Four queries:

```sql
SELECT to_tsvector('english', body) FROM kb_articles WHERE id = 2;             -- ShowTsvector (lexemes)

SELECT id, title, ts_rank(tsv, plainto_tsquery('english','brew')) AS rank      -- SearchRanked
FROM kb_articles WHERE tsv @@ plainto_tsquery('english','brew') ORDER BY rank DESC;

SELECT id, title FROM kb_articles WHERE tsv @@ to_tsquery('english','milk & cappuccino');  -- SearchAnd
SELECT id, title FROM kb_articles WHERE tsv @@ plainto_tsquery('english','brewing');       -- StemmingMatch
```

The rank (a float) is rounded with `round(...::numeric, 4)::text` — a stable printable number. The content is English: the `'english'` configuration is built in and does stemming deterministically, with no dependence on the machine locale. The unit adds its own table → `make db-reset` applies it via `brew.Apply`.

## Running it

```sh
docker compose up -d
make lecture L=07-jsonb-arrays-and-search/07-05-full-text-search T=db-reset
make lecture L=07-jsonb-arrays-and-search/07-05-full-text-search
```

Output:

```
1) tsvector тела статьи 2 (стемминг brewing→brew, hours→hour; стоп-слова выброшены):
   'brew':2,8 'cold':1 'hour':11 'sixteen':10 'temperatur':7 'time':5

2) поиск 'brew', ранжирование ts_rank (вес A заголовка > B тела):
ID  ЗАГОЛОВОК        РАНГ
2   Cold brew guide  0.6957
1   Espresso basics  0.2432

3) to_tsquery('milk & cappuccino') — нужны обе лексемы:
   1  Espresso basics
   3  Milk steaming

4) запрос 'brewing' (стем → brew) — морфология, чего не дал бы LIKE:
   1  Espresso basics
   2  Cold brew guide
```

The first block shows what a `tsvector` stores: `brewing` and `brew` merged into `'brew':2,8`, `temperature` → `'temperatur'`, `hours` → `'hour'`, while `is`/`about`/`not`/`for` were dropped as stop words. The `brew` search put "Cold brew guide" higher (`0.6957` vs `0.2432`) — the title weight kicked in. `to_tsquery` with `&` required both lexemes, and the query `brewing`, thanks to stemming, found the same as `brew`.

## The fence

FTS in Postgres is an excellent default as long as volumes are moderate and you have one or two languages. But it has limits beyond which you usually reach for an external engine (the very "handoff" from module 09 into Elasticsearch in the sibling kafka-cookbook). `ts_rank` is simple frequency ranking without learning, built-in synonyms, or typos (fuzziness is `pg_trgm`'s job, see 07-06) and without a distributed index. The language configuration must be chosen deliberately: `'english'` stems for English, Russian text needs `'russian'`, and `'simple'` doesn't stem at all. And remember the index: without a GIN on `tsv` every `@@` is a `Seq Scan` recomputing `to_tsvector` on the fly. In production you also keep synonym dictionaries/thesauri and treat relevance as a product — that's work beyond "search in the database."

## Takeaways

- FTS: text → `tsvector` (lexemes, stemmed, stop words removed), query → `tsquery`, match via `@@`.
- Stemming gives morphology for free (`brewing` finds `brew`) — something `LIKE '%...%'` can't do.
- A generated `tsvector` column (`GENERATED ALWAYS AS ... STORED`) + GIN — compute once, search by index; `setweight` lifts the title over the body.
- `ts_rank` sorts by relevance; the limits of FTS (typos, synonyms, scale) are the cue for `pg_trgm` or an external engine.

Next up — **07-06 "Fuzzy search with pg_trgm"**: FTS doesn't forgive typos — we'll add trigram similarity (`similarity`, the `%` operator), accelerated `LIKE`, and a decision matrix: when FTS, when trgm, and when it's time for an external engine.
