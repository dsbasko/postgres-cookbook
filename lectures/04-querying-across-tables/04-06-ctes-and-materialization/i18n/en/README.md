# 04-06 — CTEs and materialization

At the reports-sprint retro the team gathers at the whiteboard: what dragged over the two weeks, what got rewritten twice, where a report stayed silent instead of erroring.

> **Dmitry:** Last item — your report, "how much each customer spent." The numbers add up, all green. Open it and show everyone.

You open it. Three `SELECT`s nested one inside another: the inner one sums an order, the middle collapses per customer, the outer substitutes the name. The parentheses close somewhere at the very bottom.

> **Botyr:** I reviewed it. Tried to, rather. You can only read it inside out — by the third bracket you've already forgotten what the first `SELECT` computed.
>
> **You:** It works, though. What's wrong with it?
>
> **Dmitry:** Working isn't the same as readable. In a month you'll fix this blind. Give each step a name — and the matryoshka unfolds into a top-down pipeline: order totals, roll-up per customer, name substitution. Three steps, each visible.
>
> **Botyr:** And while we're at it, let's knock all the sprint's rakes into one sheet. Five of them already — exactly one per unit.
>
> **Dmitry:** Do it. We'll pin it above review.

Named steps are a `CTE`, the `WITH` clause; the sheet of rakes is the checklist at the end of this unit. Along the way we'll unpack materialization: whether Postgres computes a `CTE` separately or inlines it into the main query. We'll start with the `CTE`.

> [!NOTE]
> Useful from earlier units: subqueries as "a question inside a question" (04-05), `JOIN` and row multiplication fan-out (04-02), `GROUP BY` + `sum` (04-03), and prices as cents-`BIGINT` (01-01). This is the last unit of the module; at the end we'll assemble a checklist of the whole module 04's traps.

## CTE: named building blocks

`WITH name AS (query)` declares a temporary result that you then reference by name, like a table. `CTE`s can be chained: the second references the first, the main query references both.

First look at how the same three steps read without `WITH` — a subquery in the `FROM` of another subquery. You can only read it from the inside out, holding in your head what each nested level computes:

```sql
SELECT c.name, p.orders, p.spent
FROM (
    SELECT customer_id, count(*) AS orders, sum(cents)::bigint AS spent
    FROM (
        SELECT o.id, o.customer_id,
               sum(oi.quantity * oi.unit_price)::bigint AS cents
        FROM orders o JOIN order_items oi ON oi.order_id = o.id
        GROUP BY o.id, o.customer_id
    ) AS order_totals
    GROUP BY customer_id
) AS p JOIN customers c ON c.id::text = p.customer_id
ORDER BY p.spent DESC;
```

Same meaning, but the parentheses nest, the step names hide in `AS` aliases at the very bottom, and you read from the inner `SELECT` outward. A `CTE` flips this into a linear top-down pipeline:

```sql
WITH order_totals AS (        -- step 1: each order's total from line items
    SELECT o.id AS order_id, o.customer_id,
           sum(oi.quantity * oi.unit_price)::bigint AS cents
    FROM orders o JOIN order_items oi ON oi.order_id = o.id
    GROUP BY o.id, o.customer_id
),
per_customer AS (             -- step 2: collapse orders per customer
    SELECT customer_id, count(*) AS orders, sum(cents)::bigint AS spent
    FROM order_totals GROUP BY customer_id
)
SELECT c.name, p.orders, p.spent          -- step 3: substitute the name
FROM per_customer p JOIN customers c ON c.id::text = p.customer_id
ORDER BY p.spent DESC;
```

Each step is a separate named block, and the result flows top to bottom into the next:

```
WITH order_totals AS (...)    step 1 · each order's total from line items
         │
         ▼
     per_customer AS (...)    step 2 · collapse orders per customer
         │
         ▼
   SELECT … JOIN customers    step 3 · substitute the customer name
```

The main value of a `CTE` for an application is readability and reuse of an intermediate result — not "speedup." A `CTE` on its own doesn't make a query faster.

Over coffee Botyr circles back to the topic:

> **Botyr:** Listen, I always pull a subquery into a `CTE` — read that it's faster that way.
>
> **Dmitry:** Read it where?
>
> **Botyr:** …in an article from '12.
>
> **Dmitry:** PG12 rewrote the rule since then. "Faster" lives in the plan, not the query text — and plans we read in module 06. Below is what makes Postgres compute a `CTE` separately at all.

## Materialization: a fence vs inlining

Here's the subtlety. Postgres can treat a `CTE` in two ways:

- **Inline** — substitute the `CTE`'s body into the main query, like an ordinary subquery. Then the planner sees the whole query and can, for example, push a filter into the `CTE`.
- **Materialize (fence)** — compute the `CTE` separately, once, store the result in a temporary buffer, and read from it afterwards. The optimizer doesn't peek behind that "fence."

Since PG12 the default rule is: if a `CTE` is referenced **once** — it's inlined; if **more than once** (or it contains a write/`VOLATILE` function) — it's materialized (logically: computing once and reusing is cheaper than twice). A `VOLATILE` function is one whose result may change from call to call on the same arguments (`random()` or `clock_timestamp()`, say); inlining copies of it and calling it several times would be unsafe, so Postgres puts up a fence (volatility in detail — module 09). These defaults can be overridden with keywords: `AS MATERIALIZED` forces the fence, `AS NOT MATERIALIZED` forces inlining.

|   | inline | materialize (fence) |
|---|---|---|
| what it does | the `CTE`'s body is substituted into the main query | the `CTE` is computed separately, once, into a buffer |
| optimizer | sees the whole query, pushes filters in | doesn't peek behind the "fence" |
| default (PG12+) | the `CTE` is referenced once | referenced more than once (or a write/`VOLATILE`) |
| force | `AS NOT MATERIALIZED` | `AS MATERIALIZED` |

Our second query references `order_totals` twice — in `FROM` and in a scalar subquery for the grand total — so it's materialized (we wrote `AS MATERIALIZED` explicitly, but even without the keyword the default would be the same).

## What our code shows

Two queries in `query.sql`. The first is a two-`CTE` pipeline (`CustomerSpend`, above). The second is a `CTE` used twice:

```sql
-- name: OrderShareOfTotal :many
WITH order_totals AS MATERIALIZED (
    SELECT o.id AS order_id, sum(oi.quantity * oi.unit_price)::bigint AS cents
    FROM orders o JOIN order_items oi ON oi.order_id = o.id GROUP BY o.id
)
SELECT order_id, cents,
       round(100.0 * cents / (SELECT sum(cents) FROM order_totals), 1)::text AS pct
FROM order_totals ORDER BY order_id;
```

`order_totals` is read in `FROM` and in `(SELECT sum(cents) FROM order_totals)` — hence each order's share of the grand total.

## Running it

Bring up the sandbox (from the repo root) and apply the Brew base schema:

```sh
docker compose up -d
make lecture L=04-querying-across-tables/04-06-ctes-and-materialization T=db-reset
make lecture L=04-querying-across-tables/04-06-ctes-and-materialization
```

(`T=run` is the default. From inside the unit directory it's `make db-reset`, `make run`.)

Output:

```
1) Траты клиента — CTE-конвейер (order_totals → per_customer → имя):
   клиент           заказов потрачено
   Алиса Иванова          2     19.30
   Борис Петров           1      3.00
   → суммы посчитаны из позиций order_items; Карины нет — у неё заказов нет.

2) Доля заказа от общего — CTE order_totals использован дважды (FROM + scalar-подзапрос):
   заказ      сумма  доля,%
   #1          9.70    43.5
   #2          3.00    13.5
   #3          9.60    43.0
   → ссылок на CTE две → Postgres материализует его (считает один раз, переиспользует).
```

(The demo prints in Russian.) The first query read as three steps and collapsed spend per customer (totals come from `order_items`, so Alice = 9.70 + 9.60 = 19.30). The second reused one `CTE` twice and computed each order's share of the grand total (9.70 + 3.00 + 9.60 = 22.30 → 43.5% + 13.5% + 43.0%).

## The fence

What we simplified.

- The difference between inlining and materialization is visible not in the result (it's the same) but in the **plan**: a materialized `CTE` puts up a "fence" the optimizer won't push filters through, and on large data a stray `AS MATERIALIZED` sometimes hurts (the server computes the whole `CTE` even though only a couple of rows are needed outside). You can see this only via `EXPLAIN` — that's module 06, so here we only name the levers without measuring them.
- A `CTE` is about readability, not speed. The belief "I'll rewrite the subquery into a `WITH` and it'll be faster" is a myth (before PG12 materialization was always on and sometimes even hurt).
- A recursive `CTE` (`WITH RECURSIVE`) is a separate big topic: traversing trees and graphs; unit 08-04 is devoted to it.

## Common mistakes in module 04

This is the very sheet the retro agreed to pin above review — the rakes the module stepped on one by one: Karina, dropped from the report twice (04-01 and 04-05), and the "+40% revenue" that was never there (fan-out, 04-03). They all share a trait: the query doesn't fail or raise an error — it silently returns a wrong number or the wrong row. Pin it above your code review.

| trap | unit | the right way |
|---|---|---|
| `count(*)` over a `LEFT JOIN` counts result rows, not entities: a customer with no orders yields a row with `NULL` and is counted as 1 | 04-03 | count the child table's non-`NULL` key — `count(o.id)`; a customer with no pair then counts as 0 |
| `NOT IN (subquery)` over a nullable column: one `NULL` in the set and the condition collapses to `NULL`, so the result is empty for everyone | 04-05 | for "not among," use `NOT EXISTS` (or guarantee the subquery has no `NULL`) |
| `DISTINCT ON` without a tie-break in the `ORDER BY` tail: with equal sort keys the "first" row is undefined and the report floats between runs | 04-04 | extend `ORDER BY` with a unique column (`id DESC`) so the row choice is deterministic |
| a condition on the right table of a `LEFT JOIN` placed in `WHERE` (not `ON`): rows with `NULL` on the right get filtered out, and `LEFT` silently degrades into `INNER` | 04-01 | keep a filter on the right table in `ON`; in `WHERE` on the right side only an `IS NULL` check makes sense (the anti-join) |
| `sum`/`count` over fan-out: joining a parent to a child multiplies the parent's rows, so an aggregate over the parent double-counts | 04-02 | aggregate before the `JOIN` (collapse the children in a `CTE`/subquery, then join) or use `count(DISTINCT …)` |

## Takeaways

- A `CTE` (`WITH name AS (...)`) gives an intermediate result a name; the query turns from a "subquery matryoshka" into a linear pipeline of steps.
- `CTE`s can be chained: the next references the previous — that's the main value for readability.
- A `CTE` on its own doesn't speed up a query; it's about code structure, not performance.
- Since PG12: one reference → the `CTE` is inlined; more than one (or a write inside) → it's materialized. The levers are `AS MATERIALIZED` / `AS NOT MATERIALIZED`.
- The inline/materialize difference shows up in the plan (`EXPLAIN`, module 06), not in the result.

> [!NOTE]
> **Check yourself.**
> 1. Botyr from the smoke-break rewrote a slow subquery into a `WITH` and is still waiting for a speedup. What do you tell him?
> 2. A `CTE` is referenced exactly once and has no write inside. Will Postgres inline or materialize it — and which keyword forces the opposite?
> 3. In the `OrderShareOfTotal` query, drop `AS MATERIALIZED` — does the printed output (`доля,%`) change?

> [!TIP]
> **Answer.**
> 1. A `CTE` on its own doesn't speed up a query — it's about readability and code structure, not speed; before PG12 materialization was always on and sometimes even hurt. If the subquery was being inlined before, moving it into a `WITH` could even slow it down.
> 2. It inlines it (the PG12+ default for a single reference with no write/`VOLATILE`); to force the fence, use `AS MATERIALIZED`.
> 3. No. `order_totals` is referenced twice → the default already materializes the `CTE`, so the output stays the same: `#1 → 43.5`, `#2 → 13.5`, `#3 → 43.0`. The inline/materialize difference is visible in the plan (`EXPLAIN`), not in the result.

That completes module 04, "Querying across tables": you can connect tables (`JOIN`/self-join), collapse rows into summaries (`GROUP BY`/`HAVING`, `DISTINCT ON`), ask questions with questions (subqueries, `EXISTS` vs `IN`), and assemble readable pipelines (`CTE`). Next up — module **05 "Transactions, MVCC, and concurrency"**: what happens when several sessions reach for this data at once.

At that same retro, already closing his laptop, Botyr nods at the sheet of rakes:

> **Botyr:** And all of this — it's about one session. What happens when two registers reach for these rows at once?

That's where module 05 begins.
