# 04-03 — Aggregation, GROUP BY / HAVING

The first monthly revenue report is ready — and a pleased line drops into the chat:

> **Emil (in chat):** Revenue for the month — +40%. Good news?

Dmitry doesn't trust a number that good. He opens the query, runs down it top to bottom — and where the line items were pulled onto the orders to count drinks along the way, he finds the cause:

> **Dmitry:** The addends multiplied, not the money.

The report lies not in its figures but in its wiring — and there's more than one such spot in aggregates. The business rarely asks "show me all the rows." It asks in summaries: "how many drinks in each category and at what price?", "how many orders does each customer have and for how much?", "who has ordered at least twice?". The answer to such questions is aggregation: collapse many rows into one summary row per group.

And this is exactly where one of the costliest reporting mistakes lives: `count(*)` and `count(column)` look almost identical but count **different things**. On a customer with no orders the discrepancy shows immediately — and if you mix them up, a "customer activity" report quietly lies.

> [!NOTE]
> Worth carrying over from earlier lessons: `JOIN` chains and row multiplication (fan-out) when joining a parent to its children from 04-02, and sober `NULL` semantics from 03-06 (`NULL` means "unknown," and aggregates treat it specially).

## GROUP BY and aggregate functions

`GROUP BY` slices the table into groups by a column's value (or several), and an aggregate function computes one number per group: `count` — how many, `sum` — the total, `min`/`max` — the bounds, `avg` — the average. The rule: everything in `SELECT` that isn't an aggregate must appear in `GROUP BY` — otherwise it's unclear which of the group's values to show. So `SELECT category, count(*) ... GROUP BY category` is correct, while `SELECT name, count(*) ... GROUP BY category` is not (`name` is many within a group).

We round the average price and cast it to `bigint` (`round(avg(base_price))::bigint`): `avg` returns `numeric`, but we want a whole number of cents and an `int64` in Go.

> [!TIP]
> Two refinements to `count` that aren't covered elsewhere in the course but come up constantly in reports. `count(DISTINCT col)` counts **distinct** values, not rows: "how many different drinks a customer ordered" is `count(distinct oi.drink_id)` (a cappuccino taken three times is one drink, not three). And `FILTER (WHERE …)` aggregates a subset of the group's rows without splitting it into a separate query: `count(*) FILTER (WHERE o.amount >= 1000)` — how many "large" orders a customer has, alongside the plain `count(*)` over the same group. Both forms are standard SQL and work with any aggregate.

## count(\*) vs count(column) — not the same thing

This is the heart of the unit. The two `count` forms count **different things**:

- `count(*)` — how many **rows** are in the group, regardless of their contents.
- `count(column)` — how many rows where **that column is not NULL**.

On `customers LEFT JOIN orders` the difference surfaces on a customer with no orders. For Karina the `LEFT JOIN` leaves one row with `NULL` in the order columns. Then `count(*)` for her = 1 (the row exists), while `count(o.id)` = 0 (no orders, `o.id` is `NULL`). If a "how many orders does the customer have" report uses `count(*)`, Karina gets "1 order" — though she has zero. The correct order counter here is `count(o.id)`.

`sum(o.amount)` over a group with no orders returns `NULL` (not 0!) — so we wrap it in `COALESCE(..., 0)`, or Karina would have an empty revenue instead of zero.

All four forms on the very same Karina row (`LEFT JOIN`, no orders) give different results — and each difference is easy to mistake for a data bug, though it's behavior by definition:

| on Karina's row | gives | why |
|---|---|---|
| `count(*)` | `1` | counts rows; the `LEFT JOIN` left one row with `NULL` |
| `count(o.id)` | `0` | counts only non-`NULL`; `o.id` is empty |
| `sum(o.amount)` | `NULL` → `0` via `COALESCE` | no addends — that's `NULL`, not `0` |
| `avg(o.amount)` | `NULL` | an empty group has nothing to average |

## An aggregate over fan-out double-counts sums

The costliest unspoken trap of the module isn't the empty group — it's **extra** rows. In 04-02 you saw row multiplication (fan-out): joining a parent table to a child repeats each parent row once per matching child row. For a receipt report that's fine. For an aggregate it's a disaster: `sum` will add the multiplied parent column once per child.

Say we compute per-customer revenue and pull in the line items to count drinks along the way:

```sql
SELECT c.name, sum(o.amount) AS revenue          -- ❌ double-counted
FROM customers c
JOIN orders o      ON o.customer_id = c.id::text
JOIN order_items oi ON oi.order_id = o.id
GROUP BY c.id, c.name;
```

`order_items` multiplied each order's row: for an order with two items `o.amount` appears in the group **twice**, and `sum(o.amount)` counts the order's amount once per item. An order with three items — three times over. The numbers come out plausible (not negative, not zero, just "bigger than they should be"), which is why the bug survives in production for months: "revenue is up" — but it's the addends that multiplied.

> [!WARNING]
> Any `sum`/`avg`/`count` over a **parent column** on top of a parent→child `JOIN` is inflated by exactly the number of children each parent row has. Three fixes, depending on the case:
> - aggregate the child table **separately** — in a subquery or CTE — and join the finished total (we'll get to CTEs in 04-06); the cleanest path when you need both the order total and the item count;
> - sum a **child column**, not a parent one: `sum(oi.quantity * oi.unit_price)` is correct, because each line item has its own row and there's no multiplication;
> - if you need a **count** of parents, not a sum, use `count(DISTINCT o.id)` — `DISTINCT` collapses the duplicated ids back into the number of unique orders.

> [!TIP]
> How to catch the double-counting without knowing in advance: put `count(*)` and `count(DISTINCT o.id)` side by side. If they diverge, the JOIN multiplied rows, and any `sum`/`avg` over a parent column in that query is already inflated. It's the same move that distinguishes `count(*)` from `count(column)`, except now `DISTINCT` catches duplicates rather than `NULL`s.

Dmitry looks up from the whiteboard.

> **Dmitry:** What will you tell Emil?
>
> **You:** That it wasn't the money that grew, but the addends?

> **Dmitry:** And that the report now counts the money before the join.

## HAVING filters groups, not rows

`WHERE` removes rows **before** grouping; `HAVING` removes **finished groups** — by an aggregate's value. "Customers with two or more orders" can't be written as `WHERE count(o.id) >= 2`: at the `WHERE` stage the aggregate isn't computed yet. `HAVING count(o.id) >= 2` does it — it applies after `GROUP BY`, when each group's count is already known.

The query's steps run in a strict logical order, and where `WHERE` sits versus `HAVING` explains everything:

```
FROM / JOIN   →  collect rows from the tables
WHERE         →  drop rows                 (ROW filter, before grouping)
GROUP BY      →  slice into groups
aggregates    →  count / sum / min / max / avg per group
HAVING        →  drop finished groups      (GROUP filter, by an aggregate)
ORDER BY      →  order the result
```

`WHERE` still sees individual rows, `HAVING` sees already-computed groups; that's why `count(o.id) >= 2` lives only in `HAVING`.

## What our code shows

Three queries in `query.sql`. The menu summary:

```sql
-- name: MenuStatsByCategory :many
SELECT category, count(*) AS drinks, min(base_price)::bigint AS price_min,
       max(base_price)::bigint AS price_max, round(avg(base_price))::bigint AS price_avg
FROM drinks GROUP BY category ORDER BY category;
```

And per-customer stats with the two counters side by side — so the discrepancy is visible:

```sql
-- name: CustomerOrderStats:  count(*) AS rows_in_group,  count(o.id) AS orders, ...
--   ... FROM customers c LEFT JOIN orders o ON o.customer_id = c.id::text GROUP BY c.id, c.name;
-- name: RegularCustomers:    ... HAVING count(o.id) >= 2;
```

## Running it

Bring up the sandbox (from the repo root) and apply the Brew base schema:

```sh
docker compose up -d
make lecture L=04-querying-across-tables/04-03-aggregation-group-by-having T=db-reset
make lecture L=04-querying-across-tables/04-03-aggregation-group-by-having
```

(`T=run` is the default. From inside the unit directory it's `make db-reset`, `make run`.)

Output:

```
1) Сводка меню по категориям (GROUP BY category):
   катег.   напитк      min      max      avg
   coffee        3     3.00     4.80     4.10
   cold          1     5.20     5.20     5.20
   tea           1     2.50     2.50     2.50

2) Статистика по клиентам (customers LEFT JOIN orders, GROUP BY клиент):
   клиент            count(*) count(id)   выручка
   Алиса Иванова            2         2     20.10
   Борис Петров             1         1      3.00
   Карина Сидорова          1         0      0.00
   → у Карины count(*)=1 (строка есть), но count(o.id)=0 (заказов нет):
     count(*) считает строки, count(колонка) — только не-NULL значения.

3) Постоянные клиенты — HAVING count(o.id) >= 2:
   Алиса Иванова    заказов: 2, выручка: 20.10
   → HAVING фильтрует уже посчитанные группы; WHERE так не умеет.
```

(The demo prints in Russian.) Karina is the vivid case: `count(*)` and `count(o.id)` diverge precisely because the `LEFT JOIN` gave her a row with no order. `HAVING` left the single customer with two orders — Alice.

> [!NOTE]
> **Check yourself.** (1) In the `CustomerOrderStats` query Karina's `count(*)` is `1` while `count(o.id)` is `0`. Which one changes if Karina gets a single order, and what do both become? (2) Predict the output: the same query now also joins `JOIN order_items oi ON oi.order_id = o.id` and keeps `sum(o.amount)` — what revenue does Alice show (her order #1 is 10.50 with two line items, order #3 is 9.60 with one)? And what's the correct revenue?

> [!TIP]
> **Answer.** (1) Only `count(o.id)` changes: it becomes `1` (`o.id` is no longer `NULL`). `count(*)` stays `1` — there is still exactly one row, it just turned from the `NULL` row into a real order row. Both numbers end up equal at `1`: on a customer *with* orders the two forms agree; they diverge only on an empty group. (2) `order_items` multiplies order #1's row (two items → `o.amount = 10.50` twice), while order #3 stays one row. `sum(o.amount)` adds `10.50 + 10.50 + 9.60 = 30.60` instead of the correct `20.10` (as in the output above) — the classic fan-out double-counting. The correct `20.10` comes from aggregating orders separately in a CTE (or summing over `DISTINCT` orders). `sum(oi.quantity * oi.unit_price)` also removes the double-counting, but it computes *line-item* revenue — on our seed that's `19.30`: order #1's header (`10.50`) legitimately drifts from the sum of its lines (`9.70`), see the fence.

## The fence

What we simplified.

- `count(*)` and `count(column)` aren't "style" but different questions: "how many rows" vs "how many non-empty values." Reports confuse them most often, and the bug is silent — the numbers look plausible.
- We rounded the `numeric` average to whole cents deliberately. In production an "average ticket" to the hundredth of a kopek is usually pointless, but you must round explicitly, not rely on display.
- We computed revenue from `orders.amount` (the order's recorded header total), not by recomputing from the `order_items` lines — that's a different source and, in general, a different total (the header legitimately drifts from the sum of lines). In a real report it matters to pin down what exactly counts as revenue, or two "correct" figures won't agree.
- On large tables the grouping itself wants suitable indexes and sometimes hits memory limits sorting groups — but that's plan territory (module 06).

## Takeaways

- `GROUP BY` slices a table into groups; an aggregate (`count`/`sum`/`min`/`max`/`avg`) computes one number per group.
- Everything in `SELECT` that isn't an aggregate must be in `GROUP BY`.
- `count(*)` counts rows; `count(column)` counts only rows with a non-NULL value. On a `LEFT JOIN` they're different numbers.
- `sum`/`avg` over an empty group give `NULL`, not 0 — wrap in `COALESCE` if you need zero.
- `sum`/`avg` over a parent column on top of a parent→child `JOIN` is double-counted by fan-out: aggregate the children separately (subquery/CTE), sum a child column, or use `count(DISTINCT)`.
- `WHERE` filters rows before grouping, `HAVING` filters finished groups by an aggregate's value.

Aggregates collapsed each group into one number — how many, for how much, on average. But the business often needs not a figure but a specific row from the group: not "how many orders Alice has" but her **latest** order in full — date, amount, status. Fetching exactly one row per group with one concise technique that's specific to Postgres is the **04-04 "DISTINCT ON"** unit.
